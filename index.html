                    Let's get wild today. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

                    Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.

                    Maybe there's a little something happening right here. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.
